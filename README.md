## 1. Introduction to Git and GitHub

### What is Git?
- **Git** is a distributed version control system that tracks changes in files over time.
- It helps you "save checkpoints" in your project, allowing you to revert to earlier versions.
- Git is commonly used in software development to manage and collaborate on code with multiple developers.
  
### What is GitHub?
- **GitHub** is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories.
- It enables developers to store, manage, and collaborate on Git projects online.
- Think of GitHub as a social media platform for code where people can contribute, share, and collaborate on projects.

### Why Use Git and GitHub?
- **Version control**: Track and manage changes to your project over time.
- **Collaboration**: Work efficiently with team members on the same project without conflicts.
- **Backup**: Safely store your projects in the cloud and access them from anywhere.

## 2. Two Ways to Start a Git Project

### (a) Cloning an Online Repository  
- You can clone an existing repository from GitHub to work on it locally.

### (b) Creating a Local Repository and Pushing it to GitHub  
- You can create a Git repository locally and later push it to GitHub for others to access.

## 3. Personal Access Tokens (PAT) in GitHub

### What is a Personal Access Token (PAT)?
- A **Personal Access Token (PAT)** is a secure method of authentication used to interact with GitHub's API.
- It replaces passwords for Git operations like cloning, pushing, or accessing repositories.
- PATs offer more security than traditional username/password logins.

### Why Use Personal Access Tokens?
- **Enhanced Security**: Password-based access for Git operations is deprecated. PATs are a more secure alternative.
- **Fine-Grained Control**: PATs allow you to control specific permissions (e.g., repo access, workflow control).
- **Easy Revocation**: Tokens can be revoked or regenerated without affecting your account security.

### How to Generate a Personal Access Token
1. **Go to GitHub Settings**:
   - Click your profile picture in the top-right corner and select **Settings**.
   
2. **Access Developer Settings**:
   - Scroll down the sidebar to **Developer settings**.

3. **Generate New Token**:
   - Under **Personal access tokens**, click **Tokens (classic)** or **Fine-grained tokens** (for better security).
   - Click **Generate new token**.

4. **Set Permissions**:
   - Choose the scopes for the token (e.g., `repo` for repository access).
   - Limit the token's scope to specific repositories as needed.

5. **Save the Token**:
   - Copy the token displayed. You will **not** be able to see it again.
   - Store it securely in a password manager.

## 4. Practical Part 1: Cloning an Existing Repository

### Scenario: Clone an existing project from GitHub and make some changes.

1. **Create a Repository on GitHub**:
    - Go to GitHub, click **New Repository**, name it `my-cloned-repo`, and click **Create**.

2. **Copy the Repository URL**:
    - On the repository page, click the green **Code** button and copy the URL.

3. **Clone the Repository to Your Computer**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://<PAT>@github.com/username/my-cloned-repo.git
    ```
    - Replace `<PAT>` with your Personal Access Token, and `username/my-cloned-repo` with your GitHub username and repo name.
  
4. **Navigate to the Cloned Repository**:
    ```bash
    cd my-cloned-repo
    ```

5. **Create a New File (e.g., `hello.txt`)**:
    ```bash
    echo "Hello from the cloned repo!" > hello.txt
    ```

6. **Stage and Commit the File**:
    - Stage the file:
      ```bash
      git add hello.txt
      ```
    - Commit the changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add hello.txt"
      ```

7. **Push the Changes to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

8. **Check GitHub**: The new file will appear in your repository online.

## 5. Practical Part 2: Creating a Local Repository with `git init`

### Scenario: Create a new Git repository locally and push it to GitHub.

1. **Create a New Folder on Your Computer**:
    ```bash
    mkdir git_project
    cd git_project
    ```

2. **Initialize Git in the Folder**:
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
    - This tells Git to start tracking changes in this folder.

3. **Create a New File (e.g., `readme.txt`)**:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a local repo." > readme.txt
    ```

4. **Stage and Commit the File**:
    - Stage the file:
      ```bash
      git add readme.txt
      ```
    - Commit the changes:
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Add readme.txt"
      ```

5. **Create a New Repository on GitHub**:
    - Go to GitHub, click **New Repository**, name it `github_project`, and click **Create**.

6. **Connect Your Local Repo to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://PAT@github.com/username/github_project.git
    ```

7. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin main
    ```

8. **Check GitHub**: Your local files will now be uploaded to your GitHub repository.
